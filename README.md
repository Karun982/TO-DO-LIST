# 🎮 Gamified To-Do List Web App

We've seen many to-do list apps — and a common problem with them: users often list their tasks... but rarely complete them.

Taking inspiration from the world of **games**, this project introduces a **point-based system** to motivate users and visually track their progress. By making the experience feel more rewarding and goal-driven, the aim is to help users not just **create** tasks — but actually **complete** them.

## 🎯 Purpose

> ✨ The goal is simple: turn task completion into a satisfying, visual experience.

Instead of checking boxes mindlessly, users get a sense of progression through a **point progress system**. While it doesn’t include rewards or leveling yet, the visual feedback itself creates a light gamified atmosphere — enough to drive action.

- 📊 Visual **point progress** tracker (`point progress.html`)
